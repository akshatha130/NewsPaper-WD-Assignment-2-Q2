                        &nbsp;&nbsp;“Her captivating demeanour had guaranteed them consistent profits, persuading numerous individuals to commit huge quantities of money, believing that this was their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But as time passed, doubts began to surface, and the issue surfaced when the payments stopped and Brahma was unreachable,” one of the villagers told reporters on Tuesday.
